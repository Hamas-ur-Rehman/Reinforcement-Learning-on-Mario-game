# Reinforcement Learning on Mario Game

Welcome to the "Reinforcement Learning on Mario Game" project! This repository demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to train an AI agent to play the classic Mario game. By utilizing state-of-the-art RL algorithms, this project aims to develop an AI capable of mastering the game through continuous learning and adaptation.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**: Implementation of various RL algorithms such as DQN, PPO, and A3C.
- **Gym Environment**: Integration with OpenAI's Gym environment for the Mario game, providing a standardized interface for training and evaluation.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Comprehensive scripts for training the RL agent and evaluating its performance across different game levels.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing the agent's gameplay and performance metrics.
